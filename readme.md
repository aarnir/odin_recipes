In this project I'll be tackling (fearlessly) the first project in the mighty Odin Project! The focus is on HTML usage and recolling all the different ways to use it (listls, strong and emphasized etc.).

I'm hoping to strengthen my HTML understanding and make writing concise and clean markup a routine.
